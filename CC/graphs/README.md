## Code Challenge 35

### Features

#### Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
<br>

- add vertex
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: The added vertex
    - Add a vertex to the graph

<br>

- add edge
    - Arguments: 2 vertices to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
    - Returns: nothing
    - Adds a new edge between two vertices in the graph
    - If specified, assign a weight to the edge
    - Both vertices should already be in the Graph

<br>

- get vertices
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns all of the vertices in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
    - Empty collection returned if there are no vertices

<br>

- get neighbors
    - Arguments: vertex
    - Returns a collection of edges connected to the given vertex
        - Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
    - Empty collection returned if there are no vertices

<br>

- size
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns the total number of vertices in the graph
    - 0 if there are none

## Code Challenge 36
### Structure and Testing

#### Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

#### Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

#### Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be contextual, descriptive, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
<br>

#### Write tests to prove the following functionality:
- Vertex can be successfully added to the graph
- An edge can be successfully added to the graph
- A collection of all vertices can be properly retrieved from the graph
- All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
- Neighbors are returned with the weight between vertices included
- The proper size is returned, representing the number of vertices in the graph
- A graph with only one vertex and edge can be properly returned

<br>


<br>

### Feature Tasks
#### Write the following method for the Graph class:

- breadth first
- Arguments: Node
- Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
- Display the collection


<br>

### Structure and Testing
#### Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

<br>

### Example:
```
        Panda
           \ 
            Arendelle
            /       \ 
     Metroville -- Monstroplolis
        /     \    /
     Narnia -- Naboo
```
<br>

#### Output:
```
Pandora, Arendelle, Metroville, Monstroplolis, Narnia, Naboo
```

## Code Challenge 37

### Feature Tasks
- Write a function called business trip
- Arguments: graph, array of city names
- Return: the cost of the trip (if itâ€™s possible) or null (if not)
#### Determine whether the trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

<br>

### Structure and Testing
#### Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

#### Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

<br>

### Example
```
Pandora  -- $150 -- Arendelle
    \              /        \
     $82         $99         $42
       \         /             \
       Metroville -- $105 -- Monstropolis
       /         \           /
      $37         $26      $73
     /              \     /
   Narnia -- $250 -- Naboo
```

| Input	                             | Output |
| ---                                | ---    |
[Metroville, Pandora, ]	             | $82    |
[Arendelle, New Monstropolis, Naboo] | $115   |
[Naboo, Pandora]                     | null   |
[Narnia, Arendelle, Naboo]           | null   |
